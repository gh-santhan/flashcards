    {"Front":"Differentiate physical activity (PA) from exercise.","Back":"PA: any skeletal-muscle movement that raises energy expenditure above rest (occupational, transport, household, leisure). Exercise: a planned, structured, repetitive subset of PA performed to improve or maintain fitness.","Tags":["Objective2","Definitions"]},
  {"Front":"Define sedentary behavior.","Back":"Any waking behavior ≤1.5 METs in a seated, reclined, or lying posture; has distinct determinants/effects and confers independent health risk.","Tags":["Objective2","Sedentary","Definitions"]},

  {"Front":"Steps and health—what’s the practical message?","Back":"Use **steps/day** as a simple volume proxy: more is generally better with diminishing returns; there is **no magic 10,000**—focus on gradual increases from baseline.","Tags":["Objective2","Steps"]},
  {"Front":"Step intensity—what cadence suggests moderate effort?","Back":"About **100 steps/min** is a practical marker for moderate intensity for many adults (individual variation applies).","Tags":["Objective2","Steps","Intensity"]},
  {"Front":"Older adults and steps—what to emphasize?","Back":"Emphasize consistent daily stepping and breaking up sitting; moderate step goals (e.g., gradual increases of 1,000–2,000 steps/day from baseline) are effective and safer than aggressive jumps.","Tags":["Objective2","Steps","Older-Adults"]},
